# EDA_ML_Models

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a reliable ML system that can predict heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and more.

The workflow includes:

Data loading & cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Training (multiple ML models)

Model Evaluation

Final Model Selection

Prediction system







🎯 Key Findings

The dataset shows strong correlation between cholesterol, chest pain type, max heart rate and heart disease.

Among all trained models, Random Forest / SVM / Logistic Regression performed the best.

Balanced data and correct feature scaling significantly improved performance.






🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how ML can help in early detection of heart disease using simple clinical features. It also compares different algorithms to choose the best-performing model.
